# Create Armored Blocks
A addon for Create that adds some quite blast resistant blocks, made through an intuitive process. Without being Netheritely expensive of course.

## Requirements
- Create
- Create: Dreams & Desires
- (Optional but really recommended) Create Big Cannons

## Description
Create Armored Blocks is a simple but useful mod that adds blocks capable of resisting various forms of destructive damage, in a balanced way.
Most blocks in Minecraft are either negligibly blast resistant, ridiculously expensive, or just flat out not useful in any sort of protective manner.
This mod intends to change that by adding various blocks that have varying amounts of strength, all crafted through Create (and Create Dreams and Desires) systems.

## Details
One thing to note is that this mod was made and balanced with Create Big Cannons in mind, along with its swath of weaponry. (Remember that normal Minecraft has only TNT to destroy stuff.)
This mod was made to resist such forms of combat, and is ideally paired with Create Big Cannons.
